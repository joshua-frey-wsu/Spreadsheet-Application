# Spreadsheet-Application

## Project Overview

This was a project I did in my Object-Oriented Software Principles class. I made a spreadsheet application like Excel while practicing many software practices and design patterns such as TDD, DLL's, SOLID principles, GRASP, MVVM, Factory Method, Observer Method, Command Reflection. I used a C# GUI known as Winforms to develop this application. 

The TDD can't be seen or tracked on this repo since it was done on a private GitLab repo for my school.
